A backbone architecture has already been developed in Python for Jupyter Notebook. The student will work on optimizing and fine-tuning these computational methods to improve their scalability and usability.</p></div></article>

This is not a trivial task due to the complexity and variability of real tissues. Most tissues and organs have a complex 3D organisation, which contrasts with the majority of in vitro studies on 2D cultures, which do not accurately reflect reality. This project will utilise a model of developing human neuroepithelia, specifically human brain organoids, where cells adopt their features within a developing 3D organ, to study tissue architecture. It will build upon an existing computational pipeline in Bulgakova’s lab to further computational approaches for identifying patterns and changes in their architecture, leveraging a large collection of human brain organoid images available in Palacios’ lab.</p><p>The student will use MATLAB to characterise the architecture of human brain organoids, with a focus on the number, distribution, and position of dividing cells, as the correct regulation of cell division is essential for normal brain development. The computational approach will combine predictive analytics with machine learning (ML), including traditional and deep ML. The project will begin by examining Z-sections of fixed images, then proceed to a 3D reconstruction of those sections.</p><p>The student will compare the normal human brain organoids to those that are either genetically modified using CRISPR or treated with drugs broadly used in clinics. This will both validate the developed approach and test its efficacy in identifying changes to tissue architecture and phenotype.</p></div></article>

How larvae evolved is, however, contentious because the mechanisms controlling their development and diversification remain elusive.</p><p>Recently, my lab has proposed a new mechanism to explain the evolution of direct and indirect development by which temporal shifts (i.e., heterochrony) in trunk growth produce different larvae and life cycle transitions. While taxa with direct development and non-feeding larvae form the trunk during embryogenesis at the same time as the head, animals with feeding larvae form the trunk much later, close to their metamorphosis. However, we do not know how these different patterns of trunk development arise and, more importantly, whether they rely on changes in the temporal unfolding of conserved developmental processes or the evolution of entirely new genetic programmes of trunk formation.</p><p>To address this question, we have compared the development of two annelid larvae with different timings of trunk development. We have found that the Hox genes, a conserved gene family expressed in the trunk of nearly all bilaterian animals, are active at different times but might be controlled by the same genes in both species. This suggests that changes in the timing of activity of conserved genes cause the heterochronies in trunk formation in annelid larvae. However, to test this hypothesis and reveal the developmental and evolutionary principles facilitating trunk heterochronies in animals, we need to dissect how this body region develops in different larvae and identify the genes that initiate this process.</p><p>In this project, you will use time courses of single-cell transcriptomics and diverse bulk epigenomic data (ATAC-seq, CUT&Tag and Micro-C datasets) to explore the dynamics of trunk formation in two annelid species with distinct larval forms and timings of trunk development. You will learn how to analyse and process these datasets and perform temporal and cross-species comparisons. You will use the high-performance computing cluster Apocrita, expand your coding skills in Python and R, and learn how to visualise and present big data analyses in an engaging and clear manner.</p><p>My lab, the Martin Duran lab, is an international and welcoming team of seven researchers (3 postdocs, 3 PhD students, and one computational scientist; four female, three male). During your project, you will have extensive training and mentoring (with weekly meetings and regular informal chats via online messaging), as well as opportunities to present your work and gain feedback in our weekly lab meetings.</p></div></article>

At the cellular level, decision-making is controlled by gene expression that regulates the conversion of genetic information into a phenotypic output. It allows cells to determine their fate and shape their surroundings. Gene expression is surprisingly variable even between genetically identical cells and can lead to divergent behaviour of individuals within a cell population. This is particularly relevant for the survival of bacteria which are constantly exposed to fluctuating and stressful environments. Cell-to-cell variability may increase overall population fitness by enabling specialisation and division of labour to improve efficiency as well as bet-hedging by spreading the risk among individuals of being unprepared for sudden environmental change.</p><p>This interdisciplinary MSc project combines molecular cell biology with state-of-the-art biochemical imaging and advanced data analysis to reveal the physiological states of single cells within complex bacterial populations under antibiotic stress.</p><p>We have already developed statistical analysis methods to reveal the cellular diversity across bacterial populations, but we see great promise in using more advanced data science methods to pull out more nuanced insights from our data. Hence, the focus of this project will be to apply methods such cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, machine learning and AI to map divergent behaviours of individual cells. The project will provide a new context in which to understand the fundamental biological processes that shape the life cycle of bacterial cells and enable us to better predict the cellular dynamics of bacteria in response to antibiotic treatment. This knowledge will be essential when tackling the challenges associated with bacteria, may they be societal (food security), commercial (pharmaceutical production), or clinical (antimicrobial resistance).</p></div></article>

However, current approaches largely reveal population declines only after they have occurred, rather than capturing the signals of distress thatprecede declines. Detecting these signals in real time would enable timely and targeted interventions to mitigate biodiversity loss. A promising target for identifying stress signals exists in the morphology and condition of insect wings and faces, which convey a wealth of information about insect health and development. However, traditional methods for quantifying insect morphology are subjective and/or highly labour-intensive. Advances in computer vision provide exciting solutions for automating and improving these quantification methods, suggesting transformative potential for an real-time insect stress monitoring system.</p><p>The student will use existing morphological images from hundreds of wasp and bee samples, spanning several years across the UK and California. The student will contribute to developing a novel computer vision pipeline to automate quantification of wing asymmetry and variation in facial markings, both of which can serve as bioindicators of developmental instability caused by agrochemicals, pathogens, and thermal stress. The student will curate, annotate, and pre-process existing images of bee wings, wasp wings, and/or wasp faces, then will train and evaluate image segmentation models to detect and quantify wing/face features. Finally, they will implement and test algorithms for shape analysis to explore biological patterns of wing/face asymmetry across individuals and populations. The student will work in a collaborative team spanning two research teams in two institutions (QMUL and UCL), providing expertise in insect ecology and the development and use of automated AI methods. This project offers the opportunity to leverage cutting-edge AI techniques in service of pressing ecological questions.</p></div></article>

Our understanding of the complexities of these interactions has always been limited by data collection restrictions: back in the day, researchers would assign broad categories to behaviours (e.g., 'grooming', 'fight', 'play') so they could be collected using pen-and-paper, removing all qualitative information about how the interaction took place. The advent of large video datasets of interactions across species was greeted with excitement, but that soured when people realised that those videos needed to be coded. AI was meant to save everyone, but when multi-animal tracking became available, researchers reverted back to broad categorisations to identify these in large data streams. We are not much closer to using AI to ask new questions about social interactions than we were a decade ago - we can reliably find aggression in videos, but we still lump all aggressive interactions into the same category.
Social grooming in primates is probably the most intensely studied cooperative behaviour, but only with regard to who grooms whom in a primate group - a grooming bout is a grooming bout. However, when observing primates, it is clear that this is not the case for them. There are, for example, body parts that are reserved for certain partners; grooming speed and turn taking rules differ; and the process is interspersed with gestures, postural changes, and breaks that make every bout unique. These processes are too fine-grained for manual coding at a large scale, but ideal for machine learning applications because multi-animal pose estimation with software like DeepLabCut now comes with pretrained models that would allow researchers to understand behaviour at the finest scale without large, trained video datasets for the species in question.
I have around 1,500 videos of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys) grooming each other, mostly in pairs. All videos are known to contain grooming and pretrained DeepLabCut models can track the individuals in the videos, so the challenge is to make sense of the resulting data. Students will choose one social parameter of grooming interactions (e.g., who grooms, which body part is being groomed, when do breaks occur) and build analytical solutions that can capture this information in pose estimation data. You will learn about deep learning applications to animal tracking and pose estimation, about social interactions and cooperation, primate behaviour, and communication. This is proof-of-concept work - this would be the first project I am aware of that uses deep learning to extract valuable qualitative information about a social interaction type in primates.</p></div></article>

In humans, it is mainly caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite which is hosted by the female Anopheles mosquito. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes introduce the parasites via their saliva into the bloodstream of the humans they bite. In mild malaria cases, symptoms include fever, headaches, vomiting and muscle aches while in extreme cases, symptoms could include jaundice, seizures, coma and could even lead to death. The inference of demographic histories of different organism populations, in recent years, has been made possible through the application of computational statistics methods on the genomic data of the organisms in question. These inferences range from estimating the past population sizes, past migration patterns or rates to their selection histories and in general have provided a wealth of information. A more comprehensive understanding of the genetic dynamics and migration patterns of Anopheles sp. mosquitoes and their demographic histories would provide more robust surveillance and control measures against these vectors, the pathogens they spread, and would aid to predicting their future demographic changes. Therefore, studying the genetic diversity of these mosquito populations across Africa would be beneficial to reducing the high disease burden of malaria on the continent. This research will focus on utilising machine learning deep learning to predict the migration and population size changes of insecticide resistant Anopheline mosquito populations on the African continent.</p></div></article>

This remarkable conservation suggests that chromosome fusions and fissions are often not tolerated, constraining how genes can be arranged over evolutionary time. Yet, some lineages have managed to reorganize their chromosomes completely, escaping these constraints.
So far, these observations come mainly from the animal kingdom. This project will explore whether fungi show similar patterns of chromosome stability or flexibility, helping to determine whether animals are exceptional or part of a broader eukaryotic trend.
You will use comparative genomics and phylogenetic tools to analyse large-scale genome data, taking advantage of new sequencing projects (e.g. JGI, Darwin Tree of Life). The project will provide hands-on experience in genome analysis, data mining, homology detection, and evolutionary inference, as well as developing code.
By the end of the project, you will have tested key hypotheses about chromosome evolution across eukaryotes and developed valuable computational and analytical skills relevant to evolutionary genomics and bioinformatics.</p></div></article>

This remarkable capability makes them the engines of next-generation sustainable technologies, from Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) that turn waste into electricity to Microbial Electrosynthesis (MES) systems that convert CO2 into biofuels.</p><p>The efficiency of these systems is critically dependent on the applied electrode potential, which acts as a "control knob" for the bacteria's metabolism. While we know this potentially changes what the bacteria do, we lack a detailed map of how it rewires their internal gene expression.</p><p>This project will create a comprehensive map of this response. Using a new RNA-seq (transcriptomic) dataset, the student will perform a deep bioinformatic analysis to identify which genes and metabolic pathways are turned on or off at different electrical potentials, providing a foundational understanding for all bioelectrochemical technologies.</p></div></article>

We will study how network wiring and dynamics shape predictive information in artificial neural networks that respect key features of the brain wiring diagram (the connectome—i.e., which neurons connect to which).</p><p>We quantify information using Partial Information Decomposition (PID): a mathematical technique that splits the information two inputs carry about a target into (i) redundant (overlapping) parts, (ii) unique parts, and (iii) synergistic parts (information present only when inputs are combined). We will use practical PID measures such as our recently published ΦID measure (Mediano et al, 2025, PNAS) to track how synergy changes as networks learn to predict the next item in a sequence.</p><p>Our prior empirical work suggests that synergy grows with better prediction and increased synergy relates to increased consciousness and complex cognition in humans (Luppi et al 2022, Nature Neuroscience). Here we ask: which parameter settings of the model best reflect the synergistic information processing we observe in a range of animal species.</p><p>Students will (i) build simple spiking models, based closely on human and fruit-fly connectome graphs, (ii) compute PID (ΦID/O-information) over time-lagged variables, and (iii) map a “phase diagram” of synergy (a chart showing where different parameter regimes produce low vs. high synergy). We will also test whether the effect strengthens with network size. This research will greatly inform how network structure supports optimal learning, and even consciousness, in biological and artificial systems.</p><p>Students will be expected to have a solid coding knowledge, particularly in python. In addition, some mathematical background would be desirable, but not required.</p></div></article>
